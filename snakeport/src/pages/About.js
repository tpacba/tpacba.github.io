                                back-end solutions with front-end design, like "SnakePort" which
                                is my take on combining the retro arcade game with my portfolio

                    My past experience includes being a STEM educator, teaching Physics at
                    James A. Garfield High School, and Mathematics at Los Angeles Christian
                    Academy. I transitioned to web development at the beginning of 2020
                    and now aspire to become a software engineer, building apps for
                    Educational Technology.

          Just to highlight some of my work, I was able to engineer the backend
          functionalities in a recent team project, called "Smood". The app
          itself is a music player that curates the user's music according to
          their mood by fully integrating the Spotify Web API with ReactJS state
          and lifecycles. You can check out the source code for "Smood",
          "SnakePort", as well as my other projects on my{" "}
